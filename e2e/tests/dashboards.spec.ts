// Journey 16: Dean views the enrollment dashboard and stuck-students report.
// Journey 17: Executive Director views the institution dashboard.
//
// Phase 7c's factual-only design (ADR 0017): both dashboards are pure row
// counts grouped by a PRD-authoritative status enum, never institutional
// judgment.
//
// Deliberately not asserting which specific seeded student numbers appear,
// unlike most other journeys in this suite: journey 7 and journey 8 each
// hunt for "any pending_registrar_approval/pending_payment enrollment" and
// advance whichever they find (see their own header comments), and journey 6
// creates a fresh one for student4. With `fullyParallel: true` and 2 CI
// workers, file execution order is not guaranteed, so which seeded student
// ends up in-progress by the time this journey runs is not deterministic —
// only that at least one always is (the suite never drives every seeded
// enrollment to a terminal state at once). No env file sets
// `DASHBOARD_STUCK_THRESHOLD_DAYS`, so the unconfigured-threshold notice is
// an invariant regardless of ordering.
