# ADR 0026 — Credit Mapping: the Program Chair Maps, the Registrar Approves, and an Approved Credit Counts

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-09-24
**Supersedes:**
- PRD §3.8's "Registrar Staff process transferee credit mappings" (PRD §3.1, §3.4, §3.8 and FR-FIN-003 are amended to match).
- The Registrar-Staff-only reading documented in `TransfereeCreditPolicy` and `docs/data-dictionary/enrollment-records.md`.
- The earlier decision that an approved `TransfereeCredit` is record-only and must never feed `BuildEligibleSubjectPool` (PROGRESS.md Phase 7b notes). **PRD §17's open item — the official cross-institution grade equivalence — is not resolved by this ADR** (see decision 4).

## Context

Stakeholder feedback (Google Doc "WESTLIE", 2026-09-24) said credit mapping belongs to
the **Program Chair**, with Registrar Staff only **approving** it. A student who is a
transferee (or a returnee on an old curriculum) is handled by the Program Chair. The
Student should get a button to **request** credit mapping (previous school, subject
title, grade, units, school year, semester), the request should **appear to the Program
Chair**, and the system should **automatically suggest** which subjects can be credited,
while manual crediting stays available.

Before this, Registrar Staff recorded and approved credits; a Student could not ask for
one (the uncommitted student dialog's `POST` was refused with 403); nothing told a
Program Chair anything; the only "suggestion" was a code-or-title match written straight
into `subject_id`; and an approved credit was read by nothing.

## Decisions

**1. The route.** Student request → Program Chair maps → Program Chair **endorses** →
Registrar Staff approve or reject. New status `endorsed`; the chain is
`pending` → `endorsed` → `approved` | `rejected`, and the Program Chair may also
`decline` a `pending` request (a reason is required and the Student is told). Only
*approval* is the Registrar's.

| Who | May |
|---|---|
| Student | Ask for a credit for themselves (the API pins the student to the caller and ignores any `student_id`; `subject_id` is prohibited; school year and semester are required); read their own credits. |
| Program Chair | Record a credit for a student **in their own college**; map, edit, endorse or decline a `pending` credit of theirs; ask for suggestions. |
| Registrar Staff | Approve or reject an **`endorsed`** credit; read every credit. Cannot create, edit or endorse. |
| Registrar Head | Read every credit (read-only, as for enrollments, grades and withdrawals). |

A Program Chair without an assigned college is unscoped, the same fallback
`TransfereeCredit::scopeVisibleTo` already used. The Program Chair's student lookup
(`GET /academic-record/students`) is now college-scoped too.

**2. Suggestions are advice, computed on demand.** `GET /api/v1/transferee-credits/{id}/suggestions`
(`SuggestCreditSubjects`) returns up to five subjects of **the student's own curriculum**,
best first, scored on subject code (spaces and punctuation ignored), title (word by word,
prefixes of four letters or more match, filler words ignored, Roman numerals I to V read as
digits) and units, each with the reasons. Subjects the student already passed, is credited
with, or has mapped through another open or approved credit are left out. Nothing is stored
and the API **never** writes a guess into `subject_id`: a mapping is only ever the Program
Chair's decision, so a guess can never be mistaken for one. The scoring encodes no
institutional equivalence rule.

**3. Requests and notifications.** A Student's request notifies the Program Chairs of the
student's college (`transferee_credit_requested`); an endorsement notifies Registrar Staff
(`transferee_credit_endorsed`); approval, rejection and a decline notify the Student
(`transferee_credit_approved` / `_rejected`). Repeating a still-open request returns the
existing row (HTTP 200) instead of a duplicate. Every step re-checks the credit's status
under a row lock, so a repeated or racing request changes nothing a second time. Audit rows:
`transferee_credit.created`, `.updated`, `.endorsed` (new), `.approved`, `.rejected` (a
decline is a rejection, with its reason).

**4. An approved credit counts as credited, without a GRC grade.** This reverses the
record-only decision. `ResolveCreditedSubjectIds` merges the two sources of a credited
subject — curriculum-migration credits and **approved transferee credits that are mapped
to a subject** — and replaces the inline queries in `BuildEligibleSubjectPool` (the subject
is excluded as completed, with a "credited from the student's previous school" reason, and
satisfies prerequisites), `ClassifyEnrollmentStanding` and `PromoteEligibleStudents`; the
prospectus lists them (`transferee_credits`). A `pending`, `endorsed` or `rejected` credit,
or one with no mapped subject, credits nothing. A credited subject carries no grade, exactly
like a curriculum-migration credit, so **no cross-institution grade is converted or
compared, nothing feeds a GWA, and PRD §17 (official grade equivalence) stays open.**

**5. Returnees from an old curriculum keep their existing route.** The Curriculum Editor's
migration (Program Chair, college-scoped, with old-to-new equivalencies) already carries
their subjects over. The student's request form is for **subjects taken at another school**.

**6. Data.** `transferee_credits` gains `requested_by`, `endorsed_by`, `endorsed_at`, and
`credited_units` widens to `decimal(4,1)` (a student may enter 1.5; `subjects.units` already
went fractional). The status column is a plain string, so `endorsed` needs no enum change.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep Registrar Staff as the owner.** Contradicts the request and gives the people who
  know the curriculum no part in the mapping.
- **Store the suggestions, or map the best one automatically.** A stored guess is
  indistinguishable from a decision and would quietly credit subjects nobody chose.
- **Approve without an endorsement step.** Leaves no record that the Program Chair has
  finished mapping, and lets Registrar Staff approve a credit that has no subject yet.
- **Count an approved credit only as a record (as before).** Rejected by the stakeholder's
  decision: crediting a subject that changes nothing defeats the point.
- **Count it through a converted GRC grade.** Needs the official equivalence rule PRD §17
  still leaves open.

## Consequences

- **Credits approved before this change that are mapped to a subject now count as
  credited.** Under the old flow Registrar Staff could approve a `pending` credit that had a
  `subject_id`; those rows are `approved` and start taking effect. Rows still `pending` (for
  example ones Registrar Staff recorded) now wait for the Program Chair. Review the dev and
  production data before deploying.
- The Registrar Staff Credit Mappings workspace no longer has a "Record a transferee credit"
  form; it lists what the Program Chair has endorsed. The Program Chair has a new workspace
  (requests to review with suggestions, a manual subject picker, endorse or decline, and a
  walk-in form).
- One subject maps to one GRC subject (`subject_id` stays 1:1). A source subject that
  satisfies several is not modelled.
- Tests: `TransfereeCreditsEndpointTest` (ownership, college scope, chair-cannot-approve,
  registrar-only-endorsed, idempotency, notifications, suggestions),
  `ResolveCreditedSubjectIdsTest`, and the effect tests in `EligibleSubjectsEndpointTest`,
  `ClassifyEnrollmentStandingTest` and `ProspectusEndpointTest`; frontend workspace, dialog
  and role tests.
