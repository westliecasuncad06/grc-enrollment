 * Every workspace is its own chunk (ADR 0029). They used to be static imports, so
 * signing in shipped all 48 workspaces (charts, PDF/print, the 2,300-line Program
 * Chair planner) as one ~480 KB gzipped route chunk before anything rendered. Now
 * the shell and the one workspace being opened load; the rest wait until visited.
 *
 * `lazyWorkspace` keeps each `import()` literal at its call site (so the bundler
 * can split it), preserves the workspace's prop types, and records the loader so
 * `preloadConnectedModules()` can warm every chunk (tests, or a future hover
 * prefetch) without going through the component.
