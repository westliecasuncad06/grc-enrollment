 * Priority tickets always precede regular ones; within a tier, ordered by
 * `queue_date` (the Cashier's queue can span multiple Manila service days
 * once a cut-off carries tickets forward — a carry-over always sorts ahead
 * of a ticket claimed on a later date, even if the carry-over's own
 * `requeued_at` is a later raw timestamp than the newer ticket's
 * `created_at`), then effective order — `requeued_at` if the ticket was
 * ever skipped, otherwise `created_at`.
 *
 * `created_at`/`requeued_at` are whole-second timestamps, so an exact tie
 * on that effective order is routine, not a rare edge case. `id` can't be
 * the *whole* tiebreak for that tie: a low-id ticket requeued after a
 * higher-id ticket already exists must now sort *after* it, which a plain
 * `id` comparison gets backwards. So a tie first splits on whether the
 * ticket was ever requeued — never-requeued (arrival order) always
 * precedes requeued (skip moment) — and only falls back to `id` once both
 * candidates agree on that split, i.e. a true same-instant tie within one
 * regime. Mirrors `QueueTicket::position()`/`ListQueueTickets` server-side
 * exactly (`queue_date`, then effective order, then the `requeued_at IS
 * NOT NULL` regime split, then `id`).
