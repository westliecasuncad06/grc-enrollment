/**
 * PRD §17 lists the official passing-grade rule (including special marks and
 * equivalent grades) and the maximum regular-unit/overload approval workflow
 * as open institutional decisions requiring formal GRC approval. Nothing in
 * this file constitutes that approval.
 *
 * The grading values below are explicit user direction given during Phase 6
 * planning (2026-07-30), not yet a signed-off GRC decision: 3.00 is the
 * lowest passing mark on GRC's descending numeric scale (1.00 highest —
 * 5.00 failed), and INC ("Incomplete") / NC ("Not Complete") are recognised
 * special marks, notably on Leadership subjects. They are pre-populated here
 * so the system is demonstrable end to end, but every value is
 * environment-overridable, and — critically —
 * App\Domain\Academic\PrerequisiteEvaluator degrades to an explicit
 * "needs_verification" advisory, never a silent pass or fail, whenever
 * `grading.comparison` resolves to null. Update this file, not application
 * code, once GRC formally confirms the policy — see PRD §17/§18.
