/**
 * PRD §5.3 process 3.3 requires the system to "compute the approved
 * assessment"; PRD §17 lists "payment confirmation fields and supporting
 * reference requirements" as an open institutional decision, and nothing
 * in this file constitutes that approval. The values below are explicit
 * user direction given during this slice's planning (2026-08-05), not a
 * signed-off GRC decision. On 2026-08-25 the user supplied a GRC COR
 * reference whose 13.50 units / PHP 2,700.00 tuition establishes the
 * PHP 200.00 per-unit rate and whose PHP 4,700.00 other-fee total establishes
 * the line schedule below. Update this file, not application code, if GRC
 * later issues a different official schedule — see PRD §17/§18.
 *
 * `tuition_per_unit` is env-overridable (a single scalar). `miscellaneous`
 * is deliberately NOT env-overridable — a list of {label, amount} rows has
 * no safe flat-string env representation, the same reasoning already
 * applied to `enrollment.grading.special_marks` and
 * `enrollment.grading.completion_only_code_prefixes`. Edit the array
 * directly to change the fee schedule.
 *
 * Rounding policy: half-up at two decimal places. This is also
 * provisional — GRC has never specified half-up vs. banker's rounding vs.
 * round-to-nearest-peso. See App\Domain\Billing\AssessmentComputation.
