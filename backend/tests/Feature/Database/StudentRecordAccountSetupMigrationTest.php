     * `created_at` rather than leaving it null and disabled-looking.

     * Reapplies through `artisan('migrate')` rather than calling the
     * migration's `up()` directly: a direct call would leave the
     * `migrations` bookkeeping table missing rows for the rolled-back
     * migrations even though their schema changes are back in place, which
     * corrupts any later reversibility test sharing this database
     * connection within the same test run.

     * migration) through 2026_08_26_000002 to get before 2026_08_26_000001
