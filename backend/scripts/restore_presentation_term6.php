/**
 * Puts the database back into the "presentation" state the owner demos from:
 * 2025-2026 · 2nd (term 6) is the CURRENT term, its enrollment long closed, its grades locked,
 * and nothing produced for any LATER term (or by test accounts created since) is left behind.
 *
 *   php scripts/restore_presentation_term6.php            DRY RUN: does everything inside a transaction, prints
 *                                                         what it would do, then ROLLS BACK. Writes nothing.
 *   php scripts/restore_presentation_term6.php --apply    Same, but COMMITS, and only if every guard passed.
 *
 * Options: --year=2025-2026 --sem=2nd  (the term that becomes current)
 *          --accounts-since=2026-09-25  (student accounts created on/after this date are test accounts)
 *          --max-accounts=5             (abort if more accounts than this would be deleted)
 *          --max-category-reverts=5     (abort if more real students than this had their category flipped since the archive)
 *          --notifications              (also delete notifications created since the term was archived)
 *
 * What it does, in order, all in ONE transaction:
 *   1. Guards: the target term exists; every one of its grades is locked; each college has a published
 *      schedule; every enrollment window has closed; it has published sections; each account to delete
 *      has no enrollment in the target term or earlier.
 *   2. Target term -> semester_ongoing with closed_at / archived_at cleared; the current-term slot -> the target.
 *   3. Every term AFTER the target term is deleted together with everything that depends on it (sections,
 *      enrollments, payments, queue tickets, proposals, forecasts, ...), children first, by walking the real
 *      foreign-key graph, so no orphan and no RESTRICT error is left to chance.
 *   4. The test student accounts are deleted the same way, plus their audit rows and personal access tokens.
 *   4b. A real student whose category was derived again since the archive (the classifier judged them against the
 *       rehearsal's next term) gets the category the audit trail says they had before; the flip's audit rows go.
 *   4c. The student-number counter gives back the numbers the deleted accounts took from its top.
 *   4d. Queue cycles opened since the archive that hold no ticket any more are deleted; the cycle the rehearsal's
 *       first claim closed is open again.
 *   5. Audit rows that only describe the deleted things (and the target term's archive) are removed.
 *   6. Invariants: the target term and every earlier term have exactly the same section, enrollment, grade,
 *      payment and proposal counts as before; one slot row points at the target; no later term remains.
 *      Any failure throws and the transaction rolls back.
 *
 * Nothing here touches fee schedules, curricula, rooms, faculty or staff.
