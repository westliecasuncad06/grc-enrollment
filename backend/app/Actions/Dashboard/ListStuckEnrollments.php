/**
 * PRD §3.5 authorizes the Dean to see "stuck-student reports" specifically —
 * the one exception to this phase's aggregate-only rule for Dean/Executive
 * Director. Even so, this returns the minimum identifying field
 * (student_number) and nothing else personal; see StuckEnrollmentRow's
 * docblock.
 *
 * Dwell time (days in the enrollment's current status) is arithmetic over
 * the same four timestamps BuildEnrollmentSummary uses, and is always
 * returned. Whether a row counts as "stuck" is a separate, optional
 * threshold (config('enrollment.dashboard.stuck_threshold_days')) — see
 * that key's docblock for why it ships unset.
 *
 * Scoped to enrollments still *progressing toward* `enrolled`
 * (draft/pending_registrar_approval/pending_payment), not
 * Enrollment::scopeActive()'s broader "not yet terminal" set — an already
 * `enrolled` row has reached the PRD-defined lifecycle's successful
 * endpoint (EnrollmentStatus's own docblock:
 * "draft → pending_registrar_approval → pending_payment → enrolled"), so it
 * is not a candidate for "stuck" under any reading of that lifecycle,
 * without needing to invent a definition to say so.
