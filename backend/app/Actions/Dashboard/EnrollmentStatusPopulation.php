/**
 * The single definition of "which students does the Enrollment Dashboard
 * count, and where does each one sit" — shared by the overview, section,
 * student-list and student-detail Actions so their numbers can never drift
 * apart.
 *
 * One row per student, exposing:
 *   `ce.*`  the student's *current* enrollment for the term: a non-terminal
 *           enrollment if there is one, otherwise the latest terminal one.
 *           All `null` when the student has no enrollment row.
 *   `ps.section_code`  the student's section — the code covering most of the
 *           current enrollment's non-dropped subjects (ties by code), so each
 *           student is in exactly one section. `null` = "No section yet".
 *   `p.college` the student's department (program college).
 *
 * Who is counted (ADR 0024): any student with a current enrollment this term,
 * plus every eligible student without one. Eligible = an active account, not
 * graduated, and not withdrawn from the school; demo accounts are excluded,
 * as in the Honors and Attrition reports. `AdmissionStatus` is a provisional
 * vocabulary (see its docblock), so revisit this filter when GRC confirms it.
