/**
 * Restricts lookup to a Student who is actionable in the Cashier's current
 * queue. Keeping this a read-only query ensures finding a student can never
 * silently alter ticket order or enrollment/payment state.
 *
 * A candidate's ticket may be from any `queue_date`, not just today's —
 * once a cut-off carries an unserved ticket forward (see `QueueCycle`), the
 * ticket's original claim date no longer means "not currently in the
 * line"; its `status` (`waiting`/`serving`) is what does. A candidate may
 * also have no ticket at all: any `pending_payment` enrollment is a valid
 * lookup result, so Accounting Staff can issue a first ticket on a
 * student's behalf (`App\Actions\Enrollment\ClaimQueueTicket`) instead of
 * only ever serving an existing one.
