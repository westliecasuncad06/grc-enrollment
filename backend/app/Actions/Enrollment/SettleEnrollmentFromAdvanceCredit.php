/**
 * Completes an approved enrollment from the payment a freshman already made
 * (ADR 0043). A freshman who paid while every section was full holds that money as
 * credit (`account_payments` with no enrollment); when they later enroll in a section
 * that opened and Registrar Staff approve it, this finishes the enrollment from that
 * credit — no queue ticket and no second payment.
 *
 * Only for a freshman whose first payment was confirmed and whose held credit reaches
 * the minimum first payment; anyone else, or too little credit, returns false and the
 * enrollment simply carries on to the Cashier as usual. The held rows are re-pointed
 * to the enrollment (so every balance and the COR see them there), and the one
 * `Payment` row (the idempotency anchor of `ConfirmPayment`) is created for PHP 0.00 so
 * nothing is counted twice. The Cashier who took the money is the one recorded as
 * confirming, not the Registrar who approved. Running it again finds no held credit.
