/**
 * Whether a Transferee's or Returnee's credit mapping still holds enrolment back.
 *
 * Owner's rule, 2026-10-15 (amends ADR 0026 / 0043): only a credit that is still with the Program
 * Chair (`pending`) holds the student back. Once the Chair has passed the credits to the Registrar
 * Head (`endorsed`) the student may go on to enrol; the Head's approval no longer gates enrolment.
 * An endorsed credit counts for the student provisionally (`ResolveCreditedSubjectIds`) and the
 * Prospectus marks it as awaiting the Head, who still approves or rejects it afterwards.
 *
 * A student with nothing to credit says so ("no subject to credit", `NoCreditDeclaration`): while it
 * waits for the Program Chair the student is held back, and once the Chair confirms it the mapping is
 * complete with no credit rows at all. It only counts while the student has no sent credit; a credit
 * that is sent takes over.
