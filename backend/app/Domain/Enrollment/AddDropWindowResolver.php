/**
 * Pure, database-free gate for whether the add/drop/change-section window is
 * open right now — same shape as `EnrollmentWindowResolver`, no Eloquent.
 *
 * Per the approved Phase 7 design, the window opens only once ALL of the
 * following hold: the term is `semester_ongoing`, the term-wide enrollment
 * window has already closed (`enrollment_closes_at`), and the Registrar's
 * own `add_drop_deadline_at` has not yet passed. `add_drop_deadline_at` has
 * existed as a column since the term-creation schema but carried zero
 * behavior before this resolver — this is the first thing that reads it.
 *
 * Both dates missing is treated as "not open" rather than "open forever":
 * `enrollment_closes_at` and `add_drop_deadline_at` are both `required` on
 * `StoreAcademicTermRequest`, so a null value only happens on a term
 * `ArchiveAndCreateNextTerm` just created (not yet configured) — silently
 * opening add/drop for an unconfigured term would be a worse failure mode
 * than blocking it.
 *
 * The optional `$studentAlreadyEnrolled` flag bypasses the
 * `EnrollmentStillOpen` check for students who are already enrolled in the
 * term. `StoreEnrollmentChangeRequestRequest` gates on
 * `EnrollmentStatus::Enrolled` before calling this, so passing `true` here
 * is safe: the student is definitively enrolled and the only relevant
 * constraints are whether the term is ongoing and whether the add/drop
 * deadline has passed.
