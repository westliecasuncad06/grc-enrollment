 * from whether the student has an enrollment row at all — never from a
 * provisional vocabulary — so ADR 0017's enum-driven grouping rule holds.
 *
 *   enrolled      — the student's current enrollment is `enrolled`.
 *   in_progress   — `draft`, `pending_program_head_approval`,
 *                   `pending_registrar_approval` or `pending_payment`.
 *   not_enrolled  — the student started but ended without enrolling:
 *                   `rejected`, `cancelled` or `withdrawn`.
 *   not_yet_done  — an eligible student with no enrollment row this term.
