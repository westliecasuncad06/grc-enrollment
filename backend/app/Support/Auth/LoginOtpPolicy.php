/**
 * Decides whether a login must be challenged with a fresh email OTP
 * (auth-hardening batch, 2026-09-29, owner decision D4). Not required for
 * `queue_kiosk` — a shared physical-kiosk credential, not a personal inbox —
 * and not required again within `grace_minutes` of the account's last
 * verified OTP, so a legitimate user is not asked for a fresh code on every
 * single login. Per-account, not per-device: an explicit, accepted
 * simplification (no device fingerprinting exists or was asked for).
 *
 * Also not required when a Student logs in from behind an already-verified
 * Queue Kiosk device (`$viaVerifiedKioskDevice`) — the kiosk's own
 * claim-ticket flow has a student type their own credentials directly into a
 * shared physical kiosk to identify themselves, where there is no realistic
 * way to check personal email. `LoginController` sets this only after
 * confirming, the same way `EnsureStudentQueueClaimUsesKiosk` already does
 * for ticket claims, that the request carries a live, ability-scoped
 * `X-Queue-Kiosk-Token` — physical possession of that token is itself a
 * strong contextual signal, not a client-trusted flag.
