/**
 * Four roles may list grades (PRD §4.3, §5.3 DFD 3.1): the owning Student,
 * Faculty (their own sections' rosters), the Registrar Head (every grade,
 * as keeper of the official record), and Registrar Staff (every grade too —
 * PRD §3.8 "view permitted academic records", widened in Phase 7b Task 3).
 * "Which rows" is resolved by `AcademicGrade::scopeVisibleTo` — this Policy
 * is the role-level gate.
 *
 * `update` and `submit` share one ownership check (own-section, draft-only
 * content changes and the Faculty's own draft→submitted transition); `lock`
 * is a distinct, later checkpoint reserved for the Registrar Head, the same
 * two-checkpoint split `EnrollmentPolicy` uses for `decideApproval`/`void`.
