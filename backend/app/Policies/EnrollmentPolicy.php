/**
 * Four roles may list enrollments (PRD §5.3 FR-FIN-001/005): the owning
 * Student, the Registrar Head (oversight and void), Registrar Staff (the
 * approval queue), and Accounting Staff (payment queue). "Which rows" is
 * resolved by `Enrollment::scopeVisibleTo`, the same division of labor ADR
 * 0008 establishes throughout this codebase — this Policy is the role-level
 * gate, the scope is the record-level filter.
 *
 * `decideApproval` and `void` follow ADR 0011: one `PATCH` route serves two
 * different checkpoints (the initial approval queue, and an "authorized edge
 * case" override on an already-approved-but-unpaid enrollment — PRD §3.7),
 * so there is no single `role:` middleware gating the route;
 * `EnrollmentController::update` resolves the right ability from the
 * request's `action` field, mirroring `ScheduleProposalPolicy`.
